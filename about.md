Hey y'all, my name is Marcus Cruz, but I also go by Mark. I'm a student at the University of Texas at Austin studying computer science. My hobbies are photography, video games, hiking, and listening to music.

### About this site

For one of the classes I'm taking we were asked to create a website to share our experience while taking the class. So, here we are.
