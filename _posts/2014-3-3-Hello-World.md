title: Software Engineering: Week 1 Thoughts

## What did you do this past week?

The past week we learned the basics of Python and learned about some of
the tools and practices that we will be using throughout the class.

## What's in your way?

Although I had some difficulty getting started due to some personal troubles (I broke my glasses the day before classes started!), I think that I adjusted well to the new class.

## What will you do next week?

Next week, we'll be learning more Python and discussing blog entries like these.


## Thoughts

Hello Person Reading This Blog Entry,

This is my first week in the class so I'm not entirely sure how to actually start these entries, so I apologize for the messiness. If you're reading this, I assume you're interested in CS 373. Our first week was interesting (and fast, relatively speaking). It was definitely an adjustment from previous CompSci courses I've taken in that we really got off to a running start. This is my first time taking a class by Professor Downing and I'm pleasantly surprised at the pace we're getting started. We dived into looking at some (basic) code in our first class, and in the second class we looked at some tools we would be using for unit testing and coverage. My pick of the week for this week is the Jekyll now framework/service. Although I had some issues getting this up and running in my time limit (I was supposed to have done this by the end of Sunday), I think it's a pretty straight-forward and easy to use blog template. I'll need to take the time to personalize it and get familiar with the tools required to use it (aka github), but I think it should be pretty nice. Anyways, till next time! Thanks for reading.

Best,

Marcus Cruz
