## What did you do this past week?

The past week we went over the requirements for Project 1 in depth
and reviewed some of the tools that we would be using to complete it.

## What's in your way?

I haven't started the first project and although it will probably be very
easy, I have to set up my environment and get some stuff worked out. (namely, I'm
used to using the lab machines and from what I can tell, I'll mostly be working on my
personal computer for this class, so that involves installing new packages, etc.)

## What will you do next week?

Next week, I'll be starting, working on, and finishing the first project.


## Thoughts

Hello Person Reading This Blog Entry,

So, we just finished the second week of class. I don't know, I feel like I'm not putting as much effort into this class as I should be. Maybe it's senioritis or maybe it's laziness. This week we spent a lot of time going over the project (that I haven't started!). I set up my GitHub account for this class, and the repo I'm going to be using for this project, but I haven't actually looked at the project requirements, etc. I also missed class on Friday, but luckily the professor puts all the notes on Piazza (and I actually know a few people in this class!) so it wasn't as catastrophic as it could've been. I've never actually used Python, but the more that I'm learning about it, the more I like it.

My pick of the week for this week is Atom! It's a text editor made by Github, available for MacOS/Windows/Linux. It's superficially similar to Sublime, but has a lot of cool features and integrates well with Github. (I mean, I would hope so, since it's made by them....)

Anyways, till next time! Thanks for reading.

Best,

Marcus Cruz
